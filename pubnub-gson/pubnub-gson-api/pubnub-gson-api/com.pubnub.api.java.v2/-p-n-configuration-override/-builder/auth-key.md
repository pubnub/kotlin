### Deprecated

This setting is deprecated because it relates to deprecated Access Manager (PAM V2) and will be removed in the future. Please, migrate to new Access Manager (PAM V3) [migration guide available here](https://www.pubnub.com/docs/general/resources/migration-guides/pam-v3-migration)

If Access Manager (deprecated PAM v2) is utilized, client will use this authKey in all restricted requests.
