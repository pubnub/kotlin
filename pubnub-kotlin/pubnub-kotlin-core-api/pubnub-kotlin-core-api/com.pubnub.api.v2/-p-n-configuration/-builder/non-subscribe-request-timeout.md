For non subscribe operations (publish, herenow, etc), This property relates to a read timeout that is applied from the moment the connection between a client and the server has been successfully established. It defines a maximum time of inactivity between two data packets when waiting for the serverâ€™s response.

The value is in seconds.

Defaults to 10.
