This example demonstrates how to use the PushPayloadHelper class in PubNub Kotlin SDK.

PushPayloadHelper creates properly formatted payloads for FCM (Android) and APNS (iOS) push notifications to deliver to mobile devices.

Note: This is a compilation-only example as it requires valid push notification tokens to actually send notifications to devices.
